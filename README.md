# Bullish EMA with ATR filter
I wrote out a trading strategy in python. Yaay ðŸ˜žðŸ”«
In essence, if the price goes above the one hour EMA, a long position is opened. If the price goes below the EMA and the ATR is above its median, the position is closed. I wonder if I should do the same with short positionsðŸ¤”.
