# Bullish EMA with ATR filter
A trading strategy I thought up a while back (with the aid of ChatGPT.) It's promising ;). In essence, if the price goes above the one hour EMA, a long position is opened. If the price goes below the EMA and the ATR is above its median, the position is closed. I wonder if I should do the same with short positionsðŸ¤”.
